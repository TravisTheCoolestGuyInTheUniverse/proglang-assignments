Assuming we have a file Called HelloWorld.c which contains simple C code to print "Hello World" on the screen.

We compile this file with the command:
   gcc -c HelloWorld.c

This creates a .o file. THis is an object file which must be linked in order to create an executable file. 
This is done with the command
   gcc HellloWorld.o -o HelloWorld

This creates an executable file called HelloWorld, which can then be executed by typing:
   ./HelloWorld


It is possible to combine the two gcc commands into a single statement and enter:
   gcc HelloWorld.cc -o HelloWorld
