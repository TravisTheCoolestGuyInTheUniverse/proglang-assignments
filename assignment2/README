things that I want to test: 

1. I want to see how primitive data types are passed in each language
    -is it possible to change the default way of passing a primitive value?
2. I want to see how class objects are passed in each language
    -is it possible to change the default way of passing a class object?
3. I want to see how extremely large objects are passed in each language. 
    -is it possible to change the default way of passing a large object like an array?
