The purpose of this assignment was to become more familiar with how code is reused in familiar and 
unfamiliar programming languages. A generic/abstract exchange sort subprogram subprogram that is 
implemented in c++ and ada.

to run: 

cd /Scripts
./compileAndTestAll.sh

the above will compile the Ada and C++ source code, and execute it with input from the Test directory.
Output for the C++ and ada program are tested against verified correct input in the Correct directory.
Results of each test will be sent to standard output as well as the testResults directory. The testResults
directory will have a file for the test results of each program with filenames corresponding to the names
of the executables tested.
