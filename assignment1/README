The purpose of this assignment was to become more familiar with bash scripting and to use a 
language that we are not familiar with. 

compile.sh will compile a source file and put the resulting executable in the "executable" directory.
use:
./compile.sh [file name(without file extension)] [language]
ex. 
./compile.sh addCorrect fortran

test.sh will test the output of an executable against verified correct output in the "Correct" directory
using input from the "testFiles" directory. It will send the results of each test both to the terminal 
and to a file that is the name of the executable in the "testResults" folder. 
use:
./test.sh [executable filename]
ex.
./test addCorrectc (notice that the c at the end differentiates between c++ and fortran executables)

testAndCompile.sh will automatically compile all files and test them against verified correct output.
use:
./testAndCompile.sh
