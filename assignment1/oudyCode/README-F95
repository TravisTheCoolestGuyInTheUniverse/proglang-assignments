Assuming we have a file called HelloWorld.f95 which contains simple Fortran95 code to print 
"Hello World" on the screen.

We compile this file with the command:
   gfortran HelloWorld.f95 -o HelloWorld

This creates an executable file called HelloWorld, which can then be executed by typing:
   ./HelloWorld
