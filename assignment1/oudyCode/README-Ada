Assuming we have a file Called helloworld.adb which contains simple Ada code to print 
"Hello World" on the screen.

We compile this file with the command:
   g++ -c helloworld.adb

This creates a .o file. Ada uses one file for each compilation unit and these will need to be 
bound together. To create the necessary files to enable linking we execute:
   gnatbind helloworld

This creates a number of files. These now need to be linked together to create an executable file.
This is done with the command
   gnatlink helloworld

This creates an executable file called HelloWorld, which can then be executed by typing:
   ./helloworld


There is also a gnatmake command which makes the process a little easier. Google has more details on 
how to use gnatmake.
